# MFComputer
A minimally functional computer simulator/emulator.  

I initially wanted to craft my own imaginary cpu with a barebones instruction set based on selected features from the 6502, 8080A, and maybe others.  Later to be fleshed out with a monitor, assembler, tty terminal interface, text video output, APA video output, persistent storage, network capabilities.

This is rapidly changing into an 8080A emulator appliance in C#.  This feels fitting, since 2024 will be the 50th anniversary of Intel's release of the 8080A MPU.  This was the processor for two of the very earliest home computers, the Altair 8800 and IMSAI 8080.  Precursors of the TRS-80, IBM PC, and eventually modern PCs.  And arch-rivals in the great paddle-switch vs toggle-switch front panel debate. :)
