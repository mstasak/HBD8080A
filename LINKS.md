FWIW, this stuff isn't hard to find.  "emustudio" seems to have a very nice Java-based
emulation system, with assembler, disassembler, debugger, peripherals and more.  
"Z80Pack" is the proverbial kitchen sink, with tons of everything, which doesn't quite
operate right on Windows but is probably fine on Linux.
