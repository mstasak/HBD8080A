## Getting Started

The Core project contains code that can be [reused across multiple application projects](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/net-standard#net-5-and-net-standard).

HBD8080A (originally MFComputer) is a project to implement an app which emulates (perhaps simulates?) a minimal functional computer.

Perhaps it will grow into a general purpose retro emulator host, with pluggable emulations of various old CPUs (8080A, Z-80, 6800, 6502, 68000, any others I can find worthy of interest), or imaginary CPUs.
